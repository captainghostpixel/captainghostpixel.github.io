        <h1>Introduction&nbsp; &nbsp;</h1>
        <p>The topic of my website will be an official website for the British sitcom BBC Ghosts (2019) as the television show doesn’t currently have one. The site will be a platform for existing fans to check behind the scenes content and keep up to date with news, and also provide an overview of the series for new viewers who do an online search. The primary target audience for this website will be existing fans of the show. So while there will be an overview of what the show is and it’s premise, the main feature of the site will be allowing fans to look at actors' profiles and viewing behind the scenes content.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The show itself is on BBC One which means the channel's remit of ‘reflect[ing] the whole of the UK in its output’ (BBC Trust, 2016) should also be taken into consideration. Meaning, to meet such a broad audience my site will be professional, but also use colloquial and popular language. It will offer links to other parts of the website such as ‘Archive’ and ‘Gallery’ for audience members who wish to dig deeper on the BTS page if they want to, targeting different needs of the consumers within the UK’s BBC One audience demographic.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My selected approach will be minimal so that it is accessible. I will be utilising designs from singers websites such as Darren Criss (2021) and dodie (2021). I am doing this because singers like these have a wide audience therefore I know the layout will be widely accepted as it’s curated to the use of a wider audience. The layout will be minimalistic and have wide sections with lots of space so that content can be seen clearly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is important for me to keep in mind that my website needs to suit modern conventions as websites have changed overtime. Internet technology has impacted how we communicate. Exemplifying this is the advancement to Web 2.0, and the introduction of user generated content along with networking (Branston and Stafford, 2010, p.249). This made room for what we now call social media, and allows people to stay in contact on sites such as Facebook  (2004). We are able to communicate outside of ‘spatial and temporal boundaries’ (Thompson, 1995, p.31) and think of more innovative ways to communicate such as group conversations on Skype (2003).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This links into one of the modules from last semester where our class spoke about software studies. One of the points made in my weekly diary was that we are ‘a digital culture for convenience, but much more a software culture because how we do things is shaped by the current software available’ (Ginger, 2020). This relates to internet technology because developers will be thinking of new ways they can make communication more convenient using the latest software available. An example of this is the development of being able to send a suggested emoji, which then progressed to being able to select a whole sentence as a response based on what an AI has selected as an appropriate response.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Internet technology has allowed communication to become more convenient for everyone. This is both in relation to an individual and the collective. In terms of the collective, an example would be businesses or schools working together online with programmes such as Microsoft Teams (2006) The impact of internet technology was shown in the recent coronavirus pandemic which allowed businesses and operations all over the world to continue to work when without internet technology many businesses would’ve had to stop completely. In terms of the individual, the internet allows people to send emails, become content creators on social media and share information easily. The use of this technology was also shown by people keeping in contact during the pandemic. Yet, with this sharing of information and communication that does mean that some not-so-nice elements can be shared and said where they wouldn’t have been said before. Internet technology is a powerful tool, and has the possibility of being used in many different ways: the good and the bad. Communication is easier, but at what price?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In terms of my website for  Ghosts (2019), I am able to share content such as interviews with the cast, and information about the actors/actresses, and because it’s online anyone in the world can have access to it. Which is useful for television shows, especially if they are looking to promote their project overseas. This shows how internet technology has impacted how easy it is to share likes and dislikes online, and communicate effectively. &nbsp;</p>
